robot_framework
===============

This is a Dockerfile for Robot framework (http://robotframework.org)
The Docker is based on centos 6 and the latest Robot Framework based on the pip version of the install

This includes a utility called drydock.py that wraps the run of the docker with whatever tests you need in a local directory.

See the code for actual usage and external folder locations.
